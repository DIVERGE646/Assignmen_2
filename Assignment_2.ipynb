        "#ANSWER:\n",
        "\n",
        "In , dictionary keys must be immutable because dictionaries use a hashing mechanism\n",
        " to map keys to their associated values. The key's immutability ensures that the\n",
        " hash value of a key remains constant over its lifetime, allowing for efficient\n",

        "  making it impossible to retrieve the correct values associated with those keys.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "Key Reasons for Immutability:\n",
        "1. Hashing and Efficient Lookups\n",
        "•\tDictionaries in  are implemented as hash tables. When a key-value pair is added,\n",
        " computes a hash of the key, which determines where the pair will be stored.\n",
        "•\tImmutability guarantees that once the hash of a key is computed, it remains the\n",
        "same throughout the key's existence. This ensures that the dictionary can reliably\n",
        "find the value associated with a key.\n",
        "•\tMutable objects (like lists) can change, which would alter the hash value, making\n",
        "it difficult (or impossible) to retrieve the associated value using the modified key.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {1: \"one\", \"name\": \"Alice\", (10, 20): \"coordinates\"}\n",
        "print(my_dict[1])  # Output: \"one\"\n",
        "print(my_dict[(10, 20)])  # Output: \"coordinates\"\n",
        "Here, keys like 1, \"name\", and the tuple (10, 20) are immutable, meaning their\n",
        "hash value remains consistent, allowing the dictionary to retrieve the values efficiently.\n",
        "2. Ensuring Consistency of Key-Value Mappings\n",
        "•\tDictionary lookups rely on the key remaining constant. If a key could change\n",
        " (e.g., if it were a list), it would lead to unpredictable behavior.\n",
